It's small, cramped, family-owned, not very sanitary, has an open kitchen, offers simple comfort food, and everything on the menu is under $10. Yamo fits all the criteria of a \"hole in the wall\". \n\nIf you're lucky to find an empty spot on the 8 seat counter, go hang up your backpack on the wall, take a seat on the bar stool, read the sticky menu, and better order within a minute or else you will get on the bad side of Yamo's impatient waitstaff. Between three people, we shared the samusa, tea leaf salad, and a Yamo chicken house noodle. That's not enough food for a real meal here, so we got scolded by the waitress. If only she knew we chose to eat light because we had a dinner reservation 3 hours later...\n\nThe samusas were generic, they reminded me of deep fried hot pockets stuffed with a mild meat filling. Based on its texture, the samuas was definitely a frozen food product and not homemade. The supplied dipping sauce was the sweet and sour type that accompanies egg rolls. \n\nTea leaf salad (lahpet thoke) was not very memorable. Actually, it tasted even worse than the ones I've eaten at Burmese restaurants in LA. Yamo's salad was overall crunchy which I found satisfying but the flavors were very very mellow. It sorely lacked the pungent and bittersweet flavors that I expected from mixing fermented tea leaves with other ingredients in the salad, which is what makes this Burmese salad so unique. Instead, the salad tasted sweet and garlicky more than anything else.\n\nFinally, Yamo's house noodle was simplistic and ordinary, yet almost everyone else in this hole in the wall had a bowl in front of them. Egg noodles were boiled in some oily broth, then batched drained, served with some pan fried boneless chicken, peanuts, and green onions. What's so special about it? What's Burmese about it? Even after the chef drained the oil, the bowl of noodles was still a grease bomb. Not worth the $6.\n\nAs others have already mentioned, you won't find service here. The three ladies who prepare your meal are not very friendly, so it's best to eat fast and get out ASAP. The chefs appear to speak Taishanese, a Cantonese dialect, to each other and joke around. Well, the damage was $19 for this disappointing meal. Not worth it for the snack-size portions and uninspiring flavors, not worth a detour to come here.

"], "author": "Jessica M.", "review": "The Place:\nI had a bit of trouble finding the place. When I first saw it, I thought the restaurant was condemned and closed for business. The entire place consisted of a room about half the size of a classroom with a bar in the middle. On one side there's eight seats (good luck number for Chinese people), and on the other side there are the elderly chefs. They don't spend any money on making the place fancy. I went on a Monday at around 5:00, and all the seats were filled (but like I said, there aren't many seats).\n\nThe Service:\nI went for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded. One lady took my order, and she conversed with us in Burmese. Unfortunately speaking in Mandarin (no, it's NOT Cantonese) or Burmese does not get bigger portions or special treatment. Darn. The food was quick, though not much attention was paid towards the customers.\n\nThe Food:\nI don't consider Yamo's food real Burmese food, but then again I don't think Burma Superstar's food is real Burmese food. Yamo's food is cheap and is geared towards an American audience. It's very cheap ($3.50 for appetizers and $5.25 for entrees), but the food is nothing special. Portions could be bigger. Their samusas were very small, the type you can find frozen at Ranch 99 or Pacific Super. The Yamo House Noodles (or garlic noodles, as I know them to be called) could have used more flavor. The presentation was lovely, but the taste was lacking. The mango chicken wasn't anything special either. It's on about the same level as Panda Express. I was a bit disappointed with the food and the limited selection, but I figure the chefs are friends from temple who decided to go into a little business together.\n\nAll in All:\nI didn't have very high expectations, but Yamo was decent. It was cheap and pretty good for the price. I don't think it's anything special, but I'm rather biased since I've grown up eating Burmese food. I feel like the only reason the restaurant is popular is because it's cheap and it's different. If you don't know what real Burmese food is supposed to taste like, I think you'd like Yamo.

Upon entering the restaurant you'll be greeted by a very angry mama cook who seemly appears to yell at everyone: her daughter, the other mama cook and all patrons. Service is quick - you enter, you order your food while you wait to be seated - you get seated, and immediately the dishes you previously ordered are flung at you.

Tea Salad (2/5) - Burmese style salad mixed with fermented tea leaves. Salad comes premixed.The salad was more spicy and lemony than a typical Burmese tea salad, and peanuts were roasted/fried, but no longer crunchy. It was clear the salad was pre made and sitting in the fridge ready to be served. \n\n2. Mango Chicken (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with mango and chicken, served with a bed of white rice. The \"wok hei\" or in english, \"the breath of the wok\"  was real- this dish had a complex smoky flavor that is only achieved by cooking fresh ingredients over extreme heat. The flavors of the chicken coated in sauce were deep, and the bell peppers and mango retained the textural crunch. Would have liked more than 3 pieces of chicken. \n\n3. Black Bean Fish (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with black bean white fish, served with a bed of white rice. As above, the wok hei flavor was legit. Flavors were on deep and smokey. Texture was crunchy and crispy. Fish portion was could be larger. \n\n4. Yamo House Noodles (3/5) noodles mixed with garlic and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - ours was beef. Noodles were cooked almost al dante and heavily coated in oil, mixed with garlic and topped with a pinch of extremely salty beef crumbles. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood - 3.5/5 - Food here definitely has potential. On one hand the wok hei flavor is on point, on the other, portion sizes of protein is minimal and often too salty. Prices are cheap, which makes the value for food was a good bang for the buck in SF. \n\nService 1/5- From my notes above, the experience at Yamo was conflicting. I was terrified from the moment I walked in, but also couldn't help uncontrollably laugh at the situation. There were some frequenters who came for take out and you can tell they've experienced the PTSD themselves and have learned better to just get take out. One after one, they'll come in and skip the banter, and just say the numbers of the dishes they wanted to order. Put down the money and with a slight bow retreat backwards out the door where they waited patiently until their meal was prepared. Pro tip: if you want to experience yamo without the PTSD, just come for take out. \n\nEnvironment 1/5- This rating is likely skewed from the notes above - but hard to enjoy a meal when you're feeling afraid. Minimal seating ~ 10, expect to wait 30+ mins if you come during regular meal hours. Definitely come on a pre laundry day because you'll walk out smelling like Yamo. \n\nEat take out from here.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["The tea salad, while tasty, was small-- about the size of a fist.

When I walked in here the first thought in my mind was, \"Hello Susie's on 7th and Townsend!\" Susie's is a greasy spoon cafe run by two Chinese women. You SMELL like grease even if you just poke your head inside for 2 seconds. \n\nUndaunted and confident that my Yelpers wouldn't lead me wrong I orderd two standards- tea leaf salad and the cold noodles with chicken. 15 minutes the little lady behind the counter said. \n\nI stood just inside the door secretly wishing I could prop it open, and watched as the two ladies ran a bumbling and inefficient orchestra of food preparation. One would do something- i'm not quite sure what, but it wasn't very purposeful- causing the other to fall behind on whatever she was doing. One was fishing out some fried egg rolls from the fryer and the other mumbled to her that she should get my order finished and out the door since I had been there for more than 15 minutes and my food had been sitting in it's containers for at least 5, waiting for lids. \n\nI managed to escape the grease pit and drove back to work with my windows all the way down the entire way, trying to shake off the lingering tell-tale scent of a greasy spoon joint; much like a hooker's cheap perfume marking a travelling business man's shirt.\n\nSo how was it? The tea salad was a heap of disappointment. Highly salty and spicy hot, it contained a TON of little fried crunchy things. Fried onions, fried garlic, fried pumpkin seeds, fried lentils, fried batter bits; you get the picture? Oh, it had a small amount of shredded cabbage too, thinly sliced red onion, peanuts, sesame seeds and trace amounts of green onion, but by far the prevailing theme here was oil and drenching things in them. The crowning glory was that it was toped with cilantro. Shoot me now.\n\nDeciding I had enough disappointment/torture, I moved on to the cold noodles with chicken, and this was an odd dish because given the name, one might be led to believe that the dish is actually cold. Oh, no my friend. This it is not. The chicken was cooked in a mildly spicy chili/onion oil/sauce. Have I mentioned the oily mess yet? If I didn't twirl the noodles perfectly, it would flick oil. Onto my face, my clothes, my desk. It was like noodle oil bukkake. Not only was I smothered in it from the inside out, but now I'm being bathed in it too. \n\nAfter a few more bites of coating my arterial walls, I claimed surrender and put a lid on the offending meal. I felt as if I had cooking oil poured over me, and have had an uncontrollable desire to take a long, hot showers with industrial strength Dawn since then.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.

The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.

The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.

It's hard to describe but had two types of crunchiness one from some fried beans and some from the cabbage. The salad was slightly sweet, incredibly spicy but not too bad. There was a slight herbaciousness and had smokey Jasmine flavors. I really enjoyed this dish so extra stars for that. The others... not so much. I thought the house noodles were a bit bland but my friend really liked them. I remember it being a little light on the protein. The fish chowder soup had a weird flavor that I didn't quite enjoy nor could I place what was off about it. It was topped with some kind of crispy crackers? There was no actual fish in this dish. I wouldn't order this again\n\nIn all a pretty enjoyable experience but I wouldn't want to wait more than 10 mins for it... It really depends on how fast the people eat because this place is TINY.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!

But this place last week and tonight was full. Everyone sits at a counter on some funky, red vinyl covered stools. What caught my eye this time was a guy seated close to a door drinking from a straw that fed into a real coconut. I had to exam the menu in the window.\n\nAppetizers: $4.95 - only 3 choices: samusas, egg rolls and potstickers. \nSalads:       $6      - tea leaf or chicken salad\n\nAhh, the samusa and tea leaf salad on the menu immediately screamed \"Burmese\" to me. \n\nEntrees: All $6 - choice of curry beef, chicken, curry prawns, curry tofu or curry fish. Everything goes over egg noodles or rice. Don't like curry? they make a house fried rice or a house pan fried noodle. You kind of get the drift that their repetoire is strictly enforced.\n\nWhen I popped my head in, the main lady and the cook looked over the full row and then peeked over the counter and nodded me to the 1st stool right inside the door opposite the stoves. Umm, is this the best seat in the house? Or is this the worst seat?\n\nI've got to say I like the fresh air coming into the door. Didn't like the closeness of the flames from the wok shooting up in the air from the stove.\n\nWithout being in a party, I chose only one dish: curry prawns with rice. I was fascinated watching the ladies' system. The head lady takes the orders, gathers ingredients and places items in a silver dish which she lines up by the cook and the cook stir-frys each dish up and gives it back to the head lady to deliver to the customer.\n\nBack to the food: now dairy-based curry generally has a good sauce that goes good with rice. But when I was served up my dish, I found I had a reddish, oil based curry with the prawns. Foiled - not much sauce. The food was okay and definitely hot from the oven.\n\nOther male diners (with bigger appetites!) went all out ordering potstickers, curry fish noodles and fried rice and curry tofu just for two people. Some couples took out an order of the tea leaf salad on their way out. Seems like a very popular dish.\n\nIt was really interesting to watch the interplay between the ladies busting themselves to get the food out. I watched the youngest of the ladies hack (with a cleaver) at the top of a fresh coconut to pierce the shell so a straw could be inserted. Amazing.\n\nWhat else can I say?

My friend and I were semi-wandering around the Mission looking for dinner since I already had a motive to try Yamo... When we were close, I excitedly said \"ooo let's have some Burmese!\" I'm slick like that. ;) As we approached the place, we realized it was probably cash only and I only had $3 in my wallet! Good thing there was an ATM close by. We were also lucky that someone seated by the only empty seat was leaving! We secured our spots and looked over the (VERY grimy) menu. The waitress if you'd like to call her that was very friendly and was patient with our indecisiveness. We ended up with:\n\nSamosas - $3.50, This was actually the spiciest thing I had that night! It's fried right in front of you so it comes out fresh and hot. It's made with some kind of yam and spices but I honestly couldn't taste much because my tongue was in pain! \n\nTea Salad - $5.25, It's cheaper but smaller than the ones you'd find in the Richmond District. It's also spicier. The ingredients weren't as colorful and fresh looking as I'm used to. I prefer more of the nutty taste so I was hoping for more sunflower seeds and peanuts. I'd probably skip this one next time.\n\nFresh Coconut Juice - $2.50, Pretty sure everyone has had one of these but that doesn't make it any less tasty! It's a real, young coconut with the top cut off served with a straw and a spoon so you can dig into the coconut meat after you finish the juice. I say it's way worth it since you could pay that much just for a coconut at the market. I'm also too afraid of trying this at home again. Coconut shells are like rocks!\n\nMango Chicken - $5.25, with your choice of house noodles or white rice. I got the noodles and they were quite tasty! They were eggy and chewy in the good way. My friend was surprised they had real mango chunks and they were big too! This dish also came with green peppers, bits of chili peppers (so more spice!) and big flavorful chicken chunks. It was good but this dish was also a bit greasy. \n\nI'm not a fan of spicy food, though I'm getting more tolerable. It helps when all your friends like spice and INSIST that THIS THE TIME I'm going to start liking it. Nope never happened.

When we arrived, there were 3 female cooks working their butts off for a small line. The place itself can hold maybe 10 sitting customers and the rest order to go. There's no order when serving their customers and it seemed like it's easy for them to forget your order, especially when there's a long line of customers. \n\nAnyway, my boyfriend and I hadn't eaten all day and we ordered the tea salad, mango chicken, and yamo house noodles with chicken.

I was concerned about the fish quality, but hey, I lived to write this review with no stomach upsets!

Samosas are very tasty but I did find they were frozen prior, but none the less its a small operation. Pot stickers are another good one if your just craving apps or adding it to your meal.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!

You might have a hard time getting a water refill but everything else is cool--plus you're better off ordering a fresh coconut to sip on anyway--with these prices you can afford it.\n\nIt's also the ultimate place for a cheap date. You'll probably drop less than $20 on two entrees, appetizers and drinks combined.\n\nThe only thing that drops my review down to four stars is the level of cleanliness here. It's totally filthy. The menus have a layer of grime on them that defies belief. Order your food and go was your hands, trust me.

I eventually decided on the Curry Chicken and it wasn't bad or anything, but it also wasn't amazing either. It tasted really buttery to me and there were barely any chicken pieces within the plate.

I had already been forewarned that the service here is subpar, so I knew I would just be coming to pick up the salad, pay the easy-on-my-wallet $6.25 and leave. \n\nFair warning: I've had the tea leaf salad at Mandalay, Burma Love, and Burma Superstar and I absolutely love how each place makes it, albeit a bit differently across. So, I guess I had high standards coming in to Yamo and expecting that beautiful tanginess from the fermented tea leaves and overall explosion of flavors from the crispy garlic to the jalape\u00f1os. \n\nI got home super excited and sat down on my couch, wide-eyed and ready to try this dish. I took a bite and my first feeling was of disappointment. This tasted nothing like tea leaf salad and really just had a strong onion taste from the large quantity of onion immersed in the dish. The flavors were just okay, but when you're expecting a tea leaf salad, this paled in comparison. If you guys have ever had Indian bhel (common street food snack), this salad kind of tasted like that. If I had ordered bhel, it would have been fine, but I hadn't. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed with Yamo. I don't think the cheap prices make up for the quality of food that you get.

If you don't understand my Seinfield reference, go youtube this now. I assure you, it's hilarious. \n\nThe Yamo experience is a mix of PTSD of every confusing childhood memory of being scolded combined with the pleasant memory of home cooked meals prepared by your Chinese mom. \n\nThe food ranged from good to great (review below), but the experience of eating at Yamo was absolutely terrifying with a squeeze of comical. Upon entering the restaurant you'll be greeted by a very angry mama cook who seemly appears to yell at everyone: her daughter, the other mama cook and all patrons. Service is quick - you enter, you order your food while you wait to be seated - you get seated, and immediately the dishes you previously ordered are flung at you.  Yes, dishes are airborne for a few seconds before clattering loudly in front of you - maybe safe to have a napkin ready for the splash zone. \n\nOh did you want to take a photo of your food? You better take it ninja style or ask permission to take \"food photos only\" because mama cook will scream at you from across the restaurant \" NO PHOTOS\". \n\nDid you want to enjoy your food over good conversation? Hopefully you've mastered the art of talking and inhaling food at the same time, otherwise, you'll get the stare down from mama cook if your chopsticks aren't forking food into your mouth while you're swallowing forcefully. Take a tip and skip the chewing because your bill will arrive in front of you shortly. After you pay - and remember cash only - you're thanked very loudly, but if you listen between the lines, mama cook's real thoughts are GTFO because you're holding up her business. \n\nWe ate (each dish ~$6.25 pre tax): \n\n1. Tea Salad (2/5) - Burmese style salad mixed with fermented tea leaves. Salad comes premixed.The salad was more spicy and lemony than a typical Burmese tea salad, and peanuts were roasted/fried, but no longer crunchy. It was clear the salad was pre made and sitting in the fridge ready to be served. \n\n2. Mango Chicken (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with mango and chicken, served with a bed of white rice. The \"wok hei\" or in english, \"the breath of the wok\"  was real- this dish had a complex smoky flavor that is only achieved by cooking fresh ingredients over extreme heat. The flavors of the chicken coated in sauce were deep, and the bell peppers and mango retained the textural crunch. Would have liked more than 3 pieces of chicken. \n\n3. Black Bean Fish (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with black bean white fish, served with a bed of white rice. As above, the wok hei flavor was legit. Flavors were on deep and smokey. Texture was crunchy and crispy. Fish portion was could be larger. \n\n4. Yamo House Noodles (3/5) noodles mixed with garlic and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - ours was beef. Noodles were cooked almost al dante and heavily coated in oil, mixed with garlic and topped with a pinch of extremely salty beef crumbles. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood - 3.5/5 - Food here definitely has potential. On one hand the wok hei flavor is on point, on the other, portion sizes of protein is minimal and often too salty. Prices are cheap, which makes the value for food was a good bang for the buck in SF. \n\nService 1/5- From my notes above, the experience at Yamo was conflicting. I was terrified from the moment I walked in, but also couldn't help uncontrollably laugh at the situation. There were some frequenters who came for take out and you can tell they've experienced the PTSD themselves and have learned better to just get take out. One after one, they'll come in and skip the banter, and just say the numbers of the dishes they wanted to order. Put down the money and with a slight bow retreat backwards out the door where they waited patiently until their meal was prepared. Pro tip: if you want to experience yamo without the PTSD, just come for take out. \n\nEnvironment 1/5- This rating is likely skewed from the notes above - but hard to enjoy a meal when you're feeling afraid. Minimal seating ~ 10, expect to wait 30+ mins if you come during regular meal hours. Definitely come on a pre laundry day because you'll walk out smelling like Yamo. \n\nEat take out from here.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["If you want someone to serve you and make you feel like a royalty, you better go somewhere where an entree is $20 and up.

Based on its texture, the samuas was definitely a frozen food product and not homemade. The supplied dipping sauce was the sweet and sour type that accompanies egg rolls. \n\nTea leaf salad (lahpet thoke) was not very memorable. Actually, it tasted even worse than the ones I've eaten at Burmese restaurants in LA. Yamo's salad was overall crunchy which I found satisfying but the flavors were very very mellow. It sorely lacked the pungent and bittersweet flavors that I expected from mixing fermented tea leaves with other ingredients in the salad, which is what makes this Burmese salad so unique. Instead, the salad tasted sweet and garlicky more than anything else.\n\nFinally, Yamo's house noodle was simplistic and ordinary, yet almost everyone else in this hole in the wall had a bowl in front of them. Egg noodles were boiled in some oily broth, then batched drained, served with some pan fried boneless chicken, peanuts, and green onions. What's so special about it? What's Burmese about it? Even after the chef drained the oil, the bowl of noodles was still a grease bomb. Not worth the $6.\n\nAs others have already mentioned, you won't find service here. The three ladies who prepare your meal are not very friendly, so it's best to eat fast and get out ASAP. The chefs appear to speak Taishanese, a Cantonese dialect, to each other and joke around.

Please don't come here thinking you're gonna get some Burma Superstar dish; if you haven't noticed, Yamo isn't that type of \"restaurant.\" The tea leaf salad is much simpler here. In fact it reminds me of Vietnamese Goi. It's not bad, but don't get your hopes up; it won't \"blow your mind\" because it isn't supposed to be something that does. It's a nice compliment to any meal. It's not something you get as a standalone.\n\nMango Leaf Salad: 4/5\nThis one actually resembles more of the Viet salad I eat at home. It's a lot spicier so beware. I do prefer it over the tea leaf salad because of the extra ingredients and the extra kick. Like the tea leaf salad, this is supposed to go hand in hand with another dish.\n\nCold Noodle: 5/5\nAnother steal! Who knew that eating cold noodles would actually taste great? Well Yamo knows how to do it right. Be aware that it is kinda spicy for those who don't have a tolerance. Id get the house noodle over this, but this still deserves great praise. \n\n\nAtmosphere \nThe environment at Yamo is unforgettable. I get why people may think that the cooks are cranky all the time, but really? When you're working all day and night in a small room, it's very hard to stay positive.

But that's the type of service you'll get at any food location. \n\nI'm the type of person who doesn't mind sitting closely with strangers in a tight location. Yamo is that one place where you get in. Talk to some people while you wait, and get out. It's like a transaction with random surprises here and there. \n\nOh yah, the ladies will try to get you in and out as soon as possible too.

Like me, you'll probably be glad that it's the kind of place where you can drink noodle sauce right from the bowl (or you'll be glad that you don't care about manners when the payoff is so tasty). Or just get take-out and bring Yamo somewhere more highfalutin. \n\nI got #15 (Yamo house special hot-as-in-temperature noodles with pork) and #17 (chicken chow mein). The pork was ridiculous, so perfectly cooked with its slightly-crispy edges and its heady marinade aroma and its prolific appearance throughout my soba-thick noodles. #15 was garnished with crushed peanuts and chopped cilantro, and the slender slices of cooked green onion were beautiful as well as tasty against the thick sauce. #17 was appropriately-oiled, resplendent with half-mushrooms, carrots, and bok choy. The chicken was soft, in contrast to the pork, which had some appropriate tooth, and the chow mein noodles were spaghetti-thick. These were goodly-sized portions and yet not a speck of food remained behind on my dishware. Nothing about the food here feels superfluous; not one element traveled over the barrier of necessity. As in, let's reiterate that I cleaned my PLATES.\n\nOne thing that was atmospherically intriguing about Yamo was that the ceiling was high and the pendant lights were low to the counter, making the steamy, griddle-smoky space between them seem infinite.

We asked how long the wait was, got a cold stare and no response. Okay then!! We waited for about 25 minutes for a seat.\n\nLet me put this into perspective. There's 8 bar stools in a cramped little location almost the size of a long hallway. There's more kitchen space than there is seating (which is understandable). So as we are waiting, we are literally standing behind other people that are eating, hovering, really.\n\nAs we waited for a table, we placed our order so once seated they could start cooking right away. \n\nSo let's chat about something else while we wait to be seated. Service. I could not stop laughing at the way these ladies bark and yell at people. SERIOUSLY! Someone walks in and asks to place a to go order, \"WHATYOUWANT?????\" Lady taking the order writes down whatever sloppily then YELLS the dollar amount. No smile, no thank you, nothing. You don't come here for customer service. They are just outright rude, totally curt, and I find it hilarious. Forget special treatment, no one here gets any treatment! \n\nIn the meantime, there's one stool available and this guy dining on his own asks if he could take it. Sure, we are waiting for 2 stools anyways. As soon as he sits down, another barking lady yells at him to get out and wait in line because there are others in front of him (even though everyone in front of him is ordering takeout). He's finally seated when he gets to the front of the line.\n\nAlso, there's some kind of sticky dripping substance that falls from the ceiling periodically. If it falls into your hair, pretty much plan on cutting it. I'm not joking. After repeated hair washing, it's still stuck (and this is many hours later). I'll have to cut it for him once he gets back from work.\n\nWe finally sit down, and samosas follow within ten or so minutes. So freaking delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the chunky samosas filled with globs of potato and peas. The thin, crispy, perfectly folded triangles are my favorite. They were served HOT HOT HOT with some sweet and spicy chili sauce. I could have eaten double the order!\n\nNext up, the tea leaf salad. While not as good as Burma Superstar (a bit sweeter) it was still delicious and had an awesome crunch. \n\nBlack bean tofu didn't really do much for me, meh. I prefer the Burmese food here more than the Chinese.\n\nThe house noodles were my favorite. Such a simple dish, yet insanely flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it (and yes, we were sharing). Fresh noodles, garlicky, light, saucy, what more can you ask for? \n\nDidn't try any meat dishes this time around but if the vegetarian options are THIS good, I can't wait to come back and stuff my face with some fish, beef, and chicken.\n\nSince you're practically sitting IN a kitchen, you will smell like grease when you leave, and for hours later. We ended up getting gelato and drinks after and apologized for being smelly to the people we hung out with. Your eyes will also burn for the duration of your stay since there's no ventilation but...it's all worth it, especially watching the barking staff yell at you and everyone who wants to eat their food.  \"WHAT YOU WANT??

Part of the issue was there was a group of four (and I think the entire restaurant seats about 8), and even though there were 2 or 3 empty seats already, they wanted to wait until they had 4 consecutive seats together to go in. There were several groups of 2 behind them that could easily have sat down, but no, those empty seats went to waste.\n\nAs a result, we got impatient and just decided to order take-out - for that you can basically skip the line and go up to the counter to order.

Pretty spicy! I liked the mung beans and peanuts, which added a great crunch. This was definitely a unique dish.

It makes me feel right at home. \n\nWhat disappointed me about Yamo was not the service (or lack of) but the food itself. Everything is around $6 bucks but the portions are sooo small that you definitely need two orders per person. Small portions aside, the proportion of meat to carbs is just way off. For example, the famous house noodles with beef comes with 5 tiny pieces of beef. The rest is just bland noodles without any toppings or condiments. The tea salad was also a let down. I didn't even taste any lahpet in the tea salad! It was more of a 3 ingredient chopped lettuce salad. \n\n2 stars for the price and convenience.

My BF and I were lucky to snag a seat after only about a 5-minute wait at 6pm Friday evening.  I had heard that Yamo is a hole-in-the wall, so I tempered my expectations on cleanliness, courtesy and comfort accordingly and we squished in on the bar stool.\n\nAs we placed our orders - tea leaf salad, mango chicken, and house noodles with beef, we glanced around anxiously to see what everyone else had ordered, and were glad that we had chosen correctly.  However when the food came back, I was a little disappointed in the portions.  Don't get me wrong, $6.25 for a dish in SF is a steal, but the portions are probably half of what you would get at a standard Chinese take-out place, and none of the dishes were particularly savory.  Especially the tea leaf salad which was like cabbage and onions doused in sweet sticky sauce; I couldn't even taste a hint of the tea leaves.  Because it is all pre-mixed before it comes to you (I'm used to this dish being separated when presented tableside), you have no idea what is in it. \n\nThe mango chicken was fine, but is more like sweet and sour chicken.  The best dish was the house noodles with beef, and the beef portions were minuscule (as with all the other meat portions) and the noodles slippery and greasy. Since we were still hungry after the 3 dishes, we also got the curry chicken soup - there were maybe 5 tiny slivers of chicken and the broth was very bland.\n\nI have trouble categorizing this as Burmese food.  It seemed like an oily, not-as-flavorful variation of Chinese food from your typical Chinese takeout restaurant on the corner, and I didn't think it warranted any comparisons to the other more well-known Burmese establishments in SF.  Props to the older ladies behind the counter who cranked out the dishes; one of them was even wearing a wool beanie as she stir fried everything as if she could do it blindfolded.\n\n$30 for dinner for two isn't bad, but I would definitely prefer to spend 2x more on quality REAL Burmese food any other day, and eat at home the rest of the time.

We didn't get any appetizers or salad, but it was a good lunch portion even with just the entree. \n\nThe reason why I would probably never come here again to dine in is because of how rude these ladies are to their customers.

The women who work here know how to run this place efficiently, cost-effectively, and most importantly, deliciously. \n\nThe food here is nice and incredibly flavorful (and oily). The tea leaf salad is a great starter. Although it's a little on the small side, it has great flavor and it's different from your typical tea leaf salad. My two favorite entrees are the Yamo House Noodles and the Mango Chicken. The noodles are very greasy and filled with tons of flavor and a light sauce. The meat is also always tender and cooked very well. The mango chicken also has tons of flavor, as there is nothing better than mixing the rice with the sauce and chicken. The chunks of fresh mango within the dish are generous and add a nice sweetness to the dish.\n\nYes, you may not be getting the best service nor the cleanest services, but it all adds to the unique hole-in-the-wall-type vibe. It always amazes me to see how fast they are able to cook despite the lack of space and dim lighting. Even more, all the dishes here are no more than $6!

Everything goes over egg noodles or rice. Don't like curry? they make a house fried rice or a house pan fried noodle. You kind of get the drift that their repetoire is strictly enforced.\n\nWhen I popped my head in, the main lady and the cook looked over the full row and then peeked over the counter and nodded me to the 1st stool right inside the door opposite the stoves. Umm, is this the best seat in the house? Or is this the worst seat?\n\nI've got to say I like the fresh air coming into the door. Didn't like the closeness of the flames from the wok shooting up in the air from the stove.\n\nWithout being in a party, I chose only one dish: curry prawns with rice.

The head lady takes the orders, gathers ingredients and places items in a silver dish which she lines up by the cook and the cook stir-frys each dish up and gives it back to the head lady to deliver to the customer.\n\nBack to the food: now dairy-based curry generally has a good sauce that goes good with rice.

The food was okay and definitely hot from the oven.\n\nOther male diners (with bigger appetites!) went all out ordering potstickers, curry fish noodles and fried rice and curry tofu just for two people. Some couples took out an order of the tea leaf salad on their way out.

It was pretty oily but in a good way an exactly what I was craving at that moment. Everything was seasoned nicely and it tasted great. The tea leaf salad was also excellent and very different than anything I've tasted before. I'm sort of trying to reach for adjectives other than \"good\" but am coming up blank, so I'm sorry.

A place that does not consider the delicate \"feelings\" and \"sensibility\" a middle class upbringing cultivated. A place that is so uninviting to dine in, I was amazed that all the 10 seats were filled and there were maybe 8 people in outside on the sidewalk.

The heat was almost unbearable. Like being in Las Vegas in mid August with a down jacket on. The alternate reality took over. The 10 or so folks at the counter were seemingly enjoying themselves. One person scooping out the innards of  a coconut that had a hole hacked in the top, clearly enjoying the fruits of their labor. Another couple trying to figure out their new smart phone, which they acknowledged was smarter than them. The noise, the heat, the cramped quarters, the shouting woman, no sensible person would be comfortable and unaffected by the environs. Yet, they went on eating and cavorting as if everything was as it should be, as they expected and as they have accepted. Thats it.

They do not dissapoint, the flavoring on the noodles is just right (a little greasy, but that's how it's supposed to be) and you can have them with your choice of beef, chicken, fish or vegetarian (tofu/mushroom I believe).\n\nNow, a couple of things to look out for, the main thing being that this restaurant is extremely small and compact. It seats about 10 people (bar style) at most so most likely if you drop by you're going to have to wait.

Sure it's tweaked a little bit for the American taste (I mean, come on... Burma (Myanmar) is a third world country, so they don't have the luxury of putting so many ingredients into their dishes). However, the seasonings for the noodles are pretty spot on.\n\nIf you just want to come here for delicious noodles, over-rice dishes, pot stickers, samosas (pronounced samUsa in the restaurant because that's how you say it in Burmese) or egg rolls then this is a place that will not let you down!\n\nHowever, if you want to try authentic Burmese food, definitely grab an order of Tea leaf salad, or either of the two soups. I'm not a fan of fish chowder (not Yamo's fish chowder, just fish chowder in general) but the Chicken Noodle Soup (uses coconut based broth) is definitely a favorite of mine! And the house & cold noodles are also authentic to Burmese cooking, so give any of those a try to experience Burmese food (especially the Tea leaf salad).

It was near 8pm and I had to cross town to the Mission in this vast new city in order to get dinner at Yamo which closes at 9:30. Authentic Burmese food. Colour me intrigued. I walk through the Tenderloin District toward the Civic Centre BART station. This area of town is akin to Vancouver's Downtown East Side and the poverty is apparent everywhere. I come to an elevator and stupidly get in to take it down to the station.\n\nI am standing in a urinal. It's like I am actually immersed in a giant toilet. I press the button to go down and the slowest elevator in the universe begins it's descent. I touch nothing and can't decide whether to breathe through my nose and smell it, or mouth and OH FUCK... I can taste it. Urine and human filth. Puddles of piss and other unidentifiable stains keep me locked in one spot and I swear I will never ever take the lazy way out again.\n\nI arrive on the platform, efficient and easy the BART - essentially a subway - takes my 30 blocks or so in about 5 minutes. Nice. I get out and play the fun traveller game of re-orienting myself, of course this involves walking a block the wrong way as I don't like to ask people for directions. I circle around and go a block past where I need to be. I chuckle at my stupidity.\n\nI track down Yamo and the line is out the door. I'm about the fifth person back from the door. Inside 3 Asian woman work the line bellowing at each other in what I assume is Burmese but given that there are over 100 languages spoken in Burma I'm not sure. It's Cantonese-y sounding... The place is narrow and small. The hood vents don't seem to work and there is a layer of grey grease and dust on the walls and some surfaces. The open line is chaotic but seems clean enough. I guess. The place only seats 10 people and right now they are all young hip white people in their twenties and thirties. I fit right in. Usually at a place like this it's nice if everyone is of the ethnicity of the food but while I trust that I also trust faux-poor hipsters in their ability to find good cheap eats. 15 minutes and I'm in and seated at the end. It's cramped and I have to move my leg when one of the cooks needs to access the dishwasher. I really do love eating like this. The service is harsh and abrupt. Usually a good sign. Her English is limited but I just point to what I want. A traditional catfish noodle chowder and some dumplings. She get's to work. Everyone eating is friendly and chatting and I engage the couple to my left in conversation while on my right I avoid being hit by the door of the dishwasher which is causing my stool to vibrate in a delightful manner. My and my dinner companions chuckle about this. My food arrives. The dumplings aren't made in house which is a let-down. I saw her pull them from a bag in the freezer. Expectations low I take a bite. They are pretty good, boiled and then pan fried making one side delightfully crisp. A nice cabbage to pork ratio and heavy on the ginget which I like. They are served with a dipping sauce much like Vietnamese Nuoc Cham, sweet vinegary fishy. Yum..\n\nMy chowder arrives. It's thick and hot. The fish is in small chunks interspersed amongst thick egg noodles. It is pleasantly fishy and deliciously thick. A wafer like fried to crunchy type thing with bits of fried corn in it are broken up over the surface. It tastes a bit like a wheat cracker and I ask one of the women what this is.\n\"I don't know!\" She spits out, \"I'm just the cook!\" She grins a massive grin laughing wildly and returns to hacking the tops off young coconut with a massive cleaver.

This is the Asian equivalence of Peruvian Beef and Noodles, but without the tomatoes... at least to me it was. The noodles were a nice al dente, so obvious plus points for that. The steak was ultra tender, and the deglazings from the pan were used for the sauce of the dish, which was amazingly flavorful. I don't know if cilantro is growing on me, but it again worked on this dish, as the freshness cut through the oiliness and saltiness of the sauce (this saltiness and oiliness is far from a bad thing when it comes to sauce/delgazing/gravy, at least to me). And the garlic. A good amount of fried garlic and the garlic oil added to the dish. That put me over the top. This garlic was crisp and had a good amount of spice to probably also counteract the additional freshness of the cilantro that overwhelms me.

Finally you head back to the starting place assuming that you just missed it.  Then you ask yourself, \"Does this place even exist?\"\n\nAs I stood scratching my head in confusion I peered at a little craggily black storefront that looks to be condemned.

Just how \"hole in the wall\" is this place?  Well on a meter of 10 it's probably an 8.  I've been to worse but this isn't Gary Danko's.\n\nThe restaurant is essentially one part long counter with bar stools, one part open kitchen -- that's it.

The refrigerator or something made a long thumping sound and stopped after awhile.  The two ladies talk to each other in yelling pitch cantonese.  It's kinda funny how loud this place is after you get used to it.\n\nI asked for a recommendation and the lady advise me to have the \"Cold Noodles\".  The dish is like a spicy noodle salad served with temperature hot chicken.  It also has spring onion, cilantro, cucumber, carrots, and bean sprouts.  The dish isn't as fire hot as I expected yet it was just spicy enough that I could still taste my food while getting a kick.  Even so, if you don't like spicy food don't get this dish as my nose started to run profusely and I needed to resort to my can of 7-Up constantly.  Portions are just right.  I wasn't too stuffed but rather on the verge of being so.\n\nTalking to the staff was fun.  They're really friendly and open for chit chat.

One would do something- i'm not quite sure what, but it wasn't very purposeful- causing the other to fall behind on whatever she was doing.

The tea salad was a heap of disappointment. Highly salty and spicy hot, it contained a TON of little fried crunchy things.

Oh, no my friend. This it is not. The chicken was cooked in a mildly spicy chili/onion oil/sauce. Have I mentioned the oily mess yet? If I didn't twirl the noodles perfectly, it would flick oil.

I ventured in at 130 on a Saturday (actually, 138 because i was late...) and there were plenty of seats available for us.  \n\nThe first thing I did notice when I walked in was the heavy smell of oil.  I knew I was going to stink after I left which bummed me out because I was heading back to a party after...  Grr.\n\nAnyhow, the menu had several options.  All of the dishes were under $6?!?  That's my kind of place!!!!\n\nMy friend who I came with was the professional...  She promptly ordered up the Tea Tree Salad and the Chicken Noodle soup.\n\nI ended up ordering the Tofu Curry, they ask if you want it over noodles or rice.  I chose the noodles, and I'm glad I did!!!\n\nI tried some of my friends Tea Tree salad and it was DELICIOUS.  I wish I just ordered three of them and had that as my meal.....\n\nHer soup looked delicious, and my curry tofu was just okay....  It didn't have a whole lot of taste to it, but the noodles underneath it were DELICIOUS....\n\nThis place was definitely a good find.  The women working their are nice, and efficient!!!  She realized they had put my tofu over rice instead of the noodles before she even handed it to me and within only 2 minutes, problem remedied!!!\n\nI look forward to trying a few more things they have to offer, and hopefully they can throw some tofu in their chicken noodle soup instead of chicken.  I would like that.  I also enjoyed watching them work.

Seconds later, it seemed, the salad was in front of us. Served cold, it bombards you with an array of flavors, textures and spices. It is truly a hearty salad, with nuts, beans, shrimp, cabbage, tomato, and sesame seeds. Simply put, it is deliciousness--not to be missed. \n\nOh, but did I neglect to describe the shrimp curry? Its got a mountain of red and green pepper jewels, whole shrimps and mushrooms, all smothered in a savory curried sauce. Served with your choice of noodles or rice, this dish is excellent.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!  The price is so good, that adds a half star right there, pushing the average up and making this place an easy 4 stars.\n\nSo with that said, Yay!

When I first saw it, I thought the restaurant was condemned and closed for business. The entire place consisted of a room about half the size of a classroom with a bar in the middle. On one side there's eight seats (good luck number for Chinese people), and on the other side there are the elderly chefs. They don't spend any money on making the place fancy. I went on a Monday at around 5:00, and all the seats were filled (but like I said, there aren't many seats).\n\nThe Service:\nI went for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded. One lady took my order, and she conversed with us in Burmese. Unfortunately speaking in Mandarin (no, it's NOT Cantonese) or Burmese does not get bigger portions or special treatment. Darn. The food was quick, though not much attention was paid towards the customers.\n\nThe Food:\nI don't consider Yamo's food real Burmese food, but then again I don't think Burma Superstar's food is real Burmese food. Yamo's food is cheap and is geared towards an American audience. It's very cheap ($3.50 for appetizers and $5.25 for entrees), but the food is nothing special. Portions could be bigger. Their samusas were very small, the type you can find frozen at Ranch 99 or Pacific Super. The Yamo House Noodles (or garlic noodles, as I know them to be called) could have used more flavor. The presentation was lovely, but the taste was lacking. The mango chicken wasn't anything special either. It's on about the same level as Panda Express. I was a bit disappointed with the food and the limited selection, but I figure the chefs are friends from temple who decided to go into a little business together.\n\nAll in All:\nI didn't have very high expectations, but Yamo was decent. It was cheap and pretty good for the price. I don't think it's anything special, but I'm rather biased since I've grown up eating Burmese food.

We waited for about 15 minutes and popped the Lambrusco Dell'Emilia Bianco (see picture) it was pretty sweet but nice and bubbly, just fine for a paper cup and a concrete ledge.\n\nOnce inside we sat down mid bar and enjoyed the atmosphere. Yamo reminds me of Taipei in a major way, grimy and tiny with grumpy people yelling behind the counter. There was a giant sign on the wall saying \"no outside alcohol\", but that is where the opaque cups and the oversized shoulder bag come in handy. We had no problem with the under-counter fill ups. There was no pressure to order, which I thought was impressive for a tiny place with a line out front.\n\nWe ordered :\nFermented Tea Leaf Salad : It was phenomenally bright and tart. The cabbage was crispy and the nuts provided a fatty crunch that balanced the generous use of acids (lemon juice & rice vinegar?). I know that I will order this every time no matter what.\nFish Chowder: Had a definite curry undertone and a lovely, sort of powdery broth. There were little crispy bits in there too. I wouldn't miss this one either.\nHouse Noodle, Chicken: So awesomely greasy with what I consider to to be the perfect asian noodle texture, sort of al-dente but totally slippery. I was a bigger fan of this than my partner in crime was. She preferred the soup.\n\nThe wine was actually a great, light compliment to the spicy/greasy-ness, we finished the bottle and felt great. The entire affair cost less than 30 bucks!\n\nRead yelp for more on the food, or just go with your paper cups in the bag.\n\nATH\n\n\nAnd, as a final thought: what is the deal with people complaining about staff at restaurants not smiling? I don't go into a place, especially a place like Yamo, looking for a new friend. The service here is efficient and aware.

There is a \"bad reason\", however-a selfish one that I'm a little ashamed of: I'm not sure I want any more people going there! It's so small already, with literally no tables, just a counter with 7 or 8 seats. These seats are often full if you go at prime time; lunch hour or any time after 5 pm, although turn over is usually fast. I've since realized, though that the limited seating of this place is one of the aspects, along with a slight language/culture barrier, and a \"smudginess\" due to the exhaust from the cooking surfaces right behind the counter, that has allowed the prices at this place to remain low, and for it to keep off the mainstream restaurant radar, which is just fine with me. I'll gladly accept backless stools, huff a bit of grease-fire smoke, and sometimes wonder at momentarily non existent service (the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars), for truly wonderful and authentic Southeast Asian food and an almost transporting genuine asian street food style experience at dirt cheap prices. You go ahead and go to your fancy restaurants where they have actual tables and where you don't sit in the kitchen because I'll be just fine here where the fermented tea leaf salad kicks the frickin pants off the one at Burma Super Star, with it's array of way more exotic and tasty additions, like nuts I've never seen before and do not know the names of.

We asked how long the wait was, got a cold stare and no response. Okay then!! We waited for about 25 minutes for a seat.\n\nLet me put this into perspective. There's 8 bar stools in a cramped little location almost the size of a long hallway. There's more kitchen space than there is seating (which is understandable). So as we are waiting, we are literally standing behind other people that are eating, hovering, really.\n\nAs we waited for a table, we placed our order so once seated they could start cooking right away. \n\nSo let's chat about something else while we wait to be seated. Service. I could not stop laughing at the way these ladies bark and yell at people. SERIOUSLY! Someone walks in and asks to place a to go order, \"WHATYOUWANT?????\" Lady taking the order writes down whatever sloppily then YELLS the dollar amount. No smile, no thank you, nothing. You don't come here for customer service. They are just outright rude, totally curt, and I find it hilarious. Forget special treatment, no one here gets any treatment! \n\nIn the meantime, there's one stool available and this guy dining on his own asks if he could take it. Sure, we are waiting for 2 stools anyways. As soon as he sits down, another barking lady yells at him to get out and wait in line because there are others in front of him (even though everyone in front of him is ordering takeout). He's finally seated when he gets to the front of the line.\n\nAlso, there's some kind of sticky dripping substance that falls from the ceiling periodically. If it falls into your hair, pretty much plan on cutting it. I'm not joking. After repeated hair washing, it's still stuck (and this is many hours later). I'll have to cut it for him once he gets back from work.\n\nWe finally sit down, and samosas follow within ten or so minutes. So freaking delicious. I'm not a huge fan of the chunky samosas filled with globs of potato and peas. The thin, crispy, perfectly folded triangles are my favorite. They were served HOT HOT HOT with some sweet and spicy chili sauce. I could have eaten double the order!\n\nNext up, the tea leaf salad. While not as good as Burma Superstar (a bit sweeter) it was still delicious and had an awesome crunch. \n\nBlack bean tofu didn't really do much for me, meh. I prefer the Burmese food here more than the Chinese.\n\nThe house noodles were my favorite. Such a simple dish, yet insanely flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it (and yes, we were sharing). Fresh noodles, garlicky, light, saucy, what more can you ask for? \n\nDidn't try any meat dishes this time around but if the vegetarian options are THIS good, I can't wait to come back and stuff my face with some fish, beef, and chicken.\n\nSince you're practically sitting IN a kitchen, you will smell like grease when you leave, and for hours later. We ended up getting gelato and drinks after and apologized for being smelly to the people we hung out with. Your eyes will also burn for the duration of your stay since there's no ventilation but...it's all worth it, especially watching the barking staff yell at you and everyone who wants to eat their food.  \"WHAT YOU WANT?? RAAAAA\"\n\nThere's no shrimp, clearly indicated by the cartoon shrimp pictures hanging in three locations. If you ask for it, you will be yelled at, \"NOSHRIMP!!!!!!! BAAH!! NOO SHRIMP!!!!\"\n\nThis is America, no one puts up with crappy customer service. But trust me!

If you don't understand my Seinfield reference, go youtube this now. I assure you, it's hilarious. \n\nThe Yamo experience is a mix of PTSD of every confusing childhood memory of being scolded combined with the pleasant memory of home cooked meals prepared by your Chinese mom. \n\nThe food ranged from good to great (review below), but the experience of eating at Yamo was absolutely terrifying with a squeeze of comical. Upon entering the restaurant you'll be greeted by a very angry mama cook who seemly appears to yell at everyone: her daughter, the other mama cook and all patrons. Service is quick - you enter, you order your food while you wait to be seated - you get seated, and immediately the dishes you previously ordered are flung at you.  Yes, dishes are airborne for a few seconds before clattering loudly in front of you - maybe safe to have a napkin ready for the splash zone. \n\nOh did you want to take a photo of your food? You better take it ninja style or ask permission to take \"food photos only\" because mama cook will scream at you from across the restaurant \" NO PHOTOS\". \n\nDid you want to enjoy your food over good conversation? Hopefully you've mastered the art of talking and inhaling food at the same time, otherwise, you'll get the stare down from mama cook if your chopsticks aren't forking food into your mouth while you're swallowing forcefully. Take a tip and skip the chewing because your bill will arrive in front of you shortly. After you pay - and remember cash only - you're thanked very loudly, but if you listen between the lines, mama cook's real thoughts are GTFO because you're holding up her business. \n\nWe ate (each dish ~$6.25 pre tax): \n\n1. Tea Salad (2/5) - Burmese style salad mixed with fermented tea leaves. Salad comes premixed.The salad was more spicy and lemony than a typical Burmese tea salad, and peanuts were roasted/fried, but no longer crunchy. It was clear the salad was pre made and sitting in the fridge ready to be served. \n\n2. Mango Chicken (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with mango and chicken, served with a bed of white rice. The \"wok hei\" or in english, \"the breath of the wok\"  was real- this dish had a complex smoky flavor that is only achieved by cooking fresh ingredients over extreme heat. The flavors of the chicken coated in sauce were deep, and the bell peppers and mango retained the textural crunch. Would have liked more than 3 pieces of chicken. \n\n3. Black Bean Fish (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with black bean white fish, served with a bed of white rice. As above, the wok hei flavor was legit. Flavors were on deep and smokey. Texture was crunchy and crispy. Fish portion was could be larger. \n\n4. Yamo House Noodles (3/5) noodles mixed with garlic and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - ours was beef. Noodles were cooked almost al dante and heavily coated in oil, mixed with garlic and topped with a pinch of extremely salty beef crumbles. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood - 3.5/5 - Food here definitely has potential. On one hand the wok hei flavor is on point, on the other, portion sizes of protein is minimal and often too salty. Prices are cheap, which makes the value for food was a good bang for the buck in SF. \n\nService 1/5- From my notes above, the experience at Yamo was conflicting. I was terrified from the moment I walked in, but also couldn't help uncontrollably laugh at the situation. There were some frequenters who came for take out and you can tell they've experienced the PTSD themselves and have learned better to just get take out. One after one, they'll come in and skip the banter, and just say the numbers of the dishes they wanted to order. Put down the money and with a slight bow retreat backwards out the door where they waited patiently until their meal was prepared. Pro tip: if you want to experience yamo without the PTSD, just come for take out. \n\nEnvironment 1/5- This rating is likely skewed from the notes above - but hard to enjoy a meal when you're feeling afraid. Minimal seating ~ 10, expect to wait 30+ mins if you come during regular meal hours. Definitely come on a pre laundry day because you'll walk out smelling like Yamo. \n\nEat take out from here.", "rating": 2, "date": "2016-11-20"}, {"excerpts": ["My husband got the curry chicken, I got the black bean fish.

I assure you, it's hilarious. \n\nThe Yamo experience is a mix of PTSD of every confusing childhood memory of being scolded combined with the pleasant memory of home cooked meals prepared by your Chinese mom. \n\nThe food ranged from good to great (review below), but the experience of eating at Yamo was absolutely terrifying with a squeeze of comical. Upon entering the restaurant you'll be greeted by a very angry mama cook who seemly appears to yell at everyone: her daughter, the other mama cook and all patrons. Service is quick - you enter, you order your food while you wait to be seated - you get seated, and immediately the dishes you previously ordered are flung at you.  Yes, dishes are airborne for a few seconds before clattering loudly in front of you - maybe safe to have a napkin ready for the splash zone. \n\nOh did you want to take a photo of your food?

After you pay - and remember cash only - you're thanked very loudly, but if you listen between the lines, mama cook's real thoughts are GTFO because you're holding up her business. \n\nWe ate (each dish ~$6.25 pre tax): \n\n1. Tea Salad (2/5) - Burmese style salad mixed with fermented tea leaves. Salad comes premixed.The salad was more spicy and lemony than a typical Burmese tea salad, and peanuts were roasted/fried, but no longer crunchy. It was clear the salad was pre made and sitting in the fridge ready to be served. \n\n2. Mango Chicken (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with mango and chicken, served with a bed of white rice. The \"wok hei\" or in english, \"the breath of the wok\"  was real- this dish had a complex smoky flavor that is only achieved by cooking fresh ingredients over extreme heat. The flavors of the chicken coated in sauce were deep, and the bell peppers and mango retained the textural crunch. Would have liked more than 3 pieces of chicken. \n\n3. Black Bean Fish (4/5) - Stir fried vegetables with black bean white fish, served with a bed of white rice. As above, the wok hei flavor was legit. Flavors were on deep and smokey. Texture was crunchy and crispy. Fish portion was could be larger. \n\n4. Yamo House Noodles (3/5) noodles mixed with garlic and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - ours was beef. Noodles were cooked almost al dante and heavily coated in oil, mixed with garlic and topped with a pinch of extremely salty beef crumbles. \n\nOverall: \n\nFood - 3.5/5 - Food here definitely has potential. On one hand the wok hei flavor is on point, on the other, portion sizes of protein is minimal and often too salty. Prices are cheap, which makes the value for food was a good bang for the buck in SF. \n\nService 1/5- From my notes above, the experience at Yamo was conflicting. I was terrified from the moment I walked in, but also couldn't help uncontrollably laugh at the situation.

They cook to order and the broth is creamy and full, the noodles are cooked to order and they have nice full flavors of coconut, garlic, onions and cilantro.   \n\nTea Salad tea leaves, cabbage, fresh tomato, onion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds - $6 - I'm not sure why there was no tea leaves??  It was GOOD but not GREAT.  Yes all very fresh ingredients but wish there was more tea leaves to bring out that strong bitter tea leaf taste.  ah well...  maybe they should RENAME this item because if i didn't expect tea leaves i would say this is quite an excellent salad!\n\nYamo House Noodles mixed with fried garlic, and a choice of beef, chicken or pork - $6 - Greasy but so delightful!  Every bite is full of that garlic taste.  We got chicken and i absolutely LOVE the way that they prepare the chicken.  Crispy and crunchy on the outside and still juicy on the inside.  The noodles are the perfect amount of chewy and i really enjoy the sauce that they mix all together in this unique stir fry.

They have their system of running the establishment and serving your orders so you will get your food, but you should don't expect the conventional restaurant etiquette. If you keep that in mind, your \"dining experience\" will go great.\n\nThe food is yummmmyy!! I am impressed by the lightness of the dishes, and yet, I felt comforted and satisfied after I ate. The food was flavorful and hearty but without the guilt. We ordered the Tea Leaf Salad, Pot Stickers, Yamo House Noodles with Beef, and Fish Chowder Noodle Soup which were perfect for 2. Every dish had its unique flavors and none of dishes tasted what I expected. Even the pot stickers surprised me. Their use of fried broad beans to give the crunchy element is smart and inexpensive which is probably how they keep their cost down. The use of ginger is ingenious to give that spiciness you need, but not the norm of spicy you expect. If you crave for spicier, sriracha and other hot sauce condiments are available, but I would not suggest putting them on until you try a few bites and let the original flavors kick in.

It might be because the hole in the wall that Yamo calls home is comparable in size to a muni car.  And let's be honest, riding muni during rush hour sucks.  You can never get a seat at the bar and you're constantly rubbing shoulders with people to order.  Once you do get your opportunity to order, you better do it correctly or else the intimidating Burmese women might let you have it.  \n\nFor starters, I'd recommend hitting up Yamo during non-peak hours.  If you do manage to get a seat at the bar, I'd recommend sitting as far away from the door as possible.  I'd also recommend getting a fresh coconut to sip on while you wait.  \n\nAs far as food goes, I'm a huge fan of the Tea Salad, House Fried Chow Mein, and Yamo House Noodles.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!

The entire place consisted of a room about half the size of a classroom with a bar in the middle. On one side there's eight seats (good luck number for Chinese people), and on the other side there are the elderly chefs. They don't spend any money on making the place fancy. I went on a Monday at around 5:00, and all the seats were filled (but like I said, there aren't many seats).\n\nThe Service:\nI went for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded. One lady took my order, and she conversed with us in Burmese. Unfortunately speaking in Mandarin (no, it's NOT Cantonese) or Burmese does not get bigger portions or special treatment. Darn. The food was quick, though not much attention was paid towards the customers.\n\nThe Food:\nI don't consider Yamo's food real Burmese food, but then again I don't think Burma Superstar's food is real Burmese food. Yamo's food is cheap and is geared towards an American audience. It's very cheap ($3.50 for appetizers and $5.25 for entrees), but the food is nothing special. Portions could be bigger. Their samusas were very small, the type you can find frozen at Ranch 99 or Pacific Super. The Yamo House Noodles (or garlic noodles, as I know them to be called) could have used more flavor. The presentation was lovely, but the taste was lacking. The mango chicken wasn't anything special either. It's on about the same level as Panda Express.

It was cheap and pretty good for the price. I don't think it's anything special, but I'm rather biased since I've grown up eating Burmese food. I feel like the only reason the restaurant is popular is because it's cheap and it's different. If you don't know what real Burmese food is supposed to taste like, I think you'd like Yamo.

My friend was so amaze by them. Very soft and juicy on the inside. Not crispy, just a little to add in some texture. \n** Tea Salad are made with tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, onion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds. - Super small dish but love the flavors. It was really good but I think way too much onions. If you want more for the money, the other two salads are bigger in portion. \n** Yamo House Noodles made with noodles mixed with fried garlic, and a choice of meat. I got the BEEF. My favorite dish. It's like garlic noodles topped with beef for a good price. So YUMMY! I can eat that everyday. \n**Yamo Cold Noodles made with cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken. - FYI its not really cold noodle. Because they stir fry the chicken and veggies and place it on top of the noodles. Therefore making the noodles warm. I know but its so good. The sauce they use is amazing.

But when you're hungry for cheap and good Burmese food, sitting anywhere is fine.

I love experiencing new kinds of food!\n\nThe restaurant itself is ridiculously small, with only some limited counter seating, maybe seating 10 or so.  The restaurant looks like it has been around for a while too, and was incredibly popular.  The line was constant and always out the door, tho luckily, it seems that most who get their food here have are well aware that getting takeout is a much wiser choice.  \n\nAnd the prices!  Excellent prices for the cheap bastard in me.  My friend and I had three dishes, a coconut drink, and a soda for under $20.  For light eaters on a budget, one dish and a drink would be about $7 combined.  Big eaters won't go broke either.  \n\nOn to the food.\n\nTea Salad:  $5.25\n - 4.5 stars\n - Tea leave, cabbage, fresh tomato, oion, dried shrimp & variety of fried bean, nuts and sesame seeds.\n - Wow, by far my favorite dish of the day.  This taste and texture explosion is so good I wish they served it in meal portions, but alas, they only served it as a relatively small and light plate.  More like an appetizer.  It's got a variety of crunchy textures, including what feels like tiny croutons though with a saltier taste (I'm assuming it's the fried bean but might of been the dried shrimp), and the nuts (which I'm guessing may be peanuts), and the more raw veggie crunch of the cabbage.  There are also several software textures as well as the watery tomato texture.   And the taste?  Wow, there's a raw veggie tanginess to it, subtly to it, saltiness to it....Really, explosion is the only way to describe.  And it does this so cleanly and lightly that none of the tastes are overbearing.  This is a MUST ORDER at this small little hole in the wall.\n\nFish Chowder Noodle Soup $5.25\n - 2 stars\n - Soup chowder with rice noodles, shredded fish, and onions, garnished with Fried Yellowbeans and Cilantro\n - This wasn't bad, but it didn't strike me as very inspired.  The sauce was a thick reddish sauce reminiscent in texture of thick Chinese sauces poured over meats and rice.  Sorry, there should be a better explanation but I can't imagine what it is.  The noodles were very very well cooked and watery, almost like pho noodles, only it didn't seem to be the way these noodles were supposed to be.  The taste was subtle...almost too subtle.  Perhaps, tho, I'm being a little harsh because of the great tastes of the other dishes, but really, I wouldn't order this again.\n\nYamo Cold Noodles $5.25\n - 3.5 stars\n - Cold noodles mixed with house special flavor, onions, cabbage, cucumbers, and chicken\n - Pretty good dish.  The noodles are similar to chow mein noodles but without the glossy oiliness.  This was their spicy dish, but it's more tangy than spicy.  The chicken was covered in a thick, almost dry red sauce with lots of full sized peppers (like the dry peppers found in jars at the table at pizza restaurants).  This dish was also full of different flavors giving a nice complexity to the dish.  I would order this again.\n\nFresh Coconut $2.50\n - 4 stars\n - All my life, I thought coconuts had a stronger taste because coconut flakes used in cakes had such a strong flavor.  What a surprise to find the taste was so subtle, if you had told me it was a different fruit, I would have believed you.  So light, refreshing.  Loved it.  I also liked that it came in a full coconut rather than a glass.  It was fun to see, and we could scrape the inside for the thicker fruity part of the coconut.    Yeah, I'd order this again, just for the novelty of it.  \n\nGrass Jelly drink $1.00\n - 2.5 stars\n - This is a can drink.  Not carbonated, with bits of jelly in it.  It's similar in taste to Chinese turtle shell gelatin desserts.  I'd drink it again if it was served, but probably wouldn't ever be my first choice.  Still, it tasted like it was probably a healthy drink.\n\nThough we didn't order it, the customer sitting next to us order what I think (just guessing mind you) is the Yamo House Noodles.  That looked really good.  Basically several bite sized pieces of chicken (looking like it was cooked in a thick dark sauce) over a bed of the chow mein like noodles.  It sure as heck looked good.\n\nAll in all, this place was pretty good.  If I would have rated it a straight 3.5, I'd got to 4, but given that all the food combined average below a 3.5, I'll have to go with a 3 today.\n\nExcept...the price!  The price is so good, that adds a half star right there, pushing the average up and making this place an easy 4 stars.\n\nSo with that said, Yay!

You kind of get the drift that their repetoire is strictly enforced.\n\nWhen I popped my head in, the main lady and the cook looked over the full row and then peeked over the counter and nodded me to the 1st stool right inside the door opposite the stoves. Umm, is this the best seat in the house? Or is this the worst seat?\n\nI've got to say I like the fresh air coming into the door. Didn't like the closeness of the flames from the wok shooting up in the air from the stove.\n\nWithout being in a party, I chose only one dish: curry prawns with rice. I was fascinated watching the ladies' system. The head lady takes the orders, gathers ingredients and places items in a silver dish which she lines up by the cook and the cook stir-frys each dish up and gives it back to the head lady to deliver to the customer.\n\nBack to the food: now dairy-based curry generally has a good sauce that goes good with rice. But when I was served up my dish, I found I had a reddish, oil based curry with the prawns. Foiled - not much sauce. The food was okay and definitely hot from the oven.\n\nOther male diners (with bigger appetites!) went all out ordering potstickers, curry fish noodles and fried rice and curry tofu just for two people.

But this place last week and tonight was full. Everyone sits at a counter on some funky, red vinyl covered stools. What caught my eye this time was a guy seated close to a door drinking from a straw that fed into a real coconut. I had to exam the menu in the window.\n\nAppetizers: $4.95 - only 3 choices: samusas, egg rolls and potstickers. \nSalads:       $6      - tea leaf or chicken salad\n\nAhh, the samusa and tea leaf salad on the menu immediately screamed \"Burmese\" to me. \n\nEntrees: All $6 - choice of curry beef, chicken, curry prawns, curry tofu or curry fish. Everything goes over egg noodles or rice. Don't like curry? they make a house fried rice or a house pan fried noodle. You kind of get the drift that their repetoire is strictly enforced.\n\nWhen I popped my head in, the main lady and the cook looked over the full row and then peeked over the counter and nodded me to the 1st stool right inside the door opposite the stoves. Umm, is this the best seat in the house? Or is this the worst seat?\n\nI've got to say I like the fresh air coming into the door. Didn't like the closeness of the flames from the wok shooting up in the air from the stove.\n\nWithout being in a party, I chose only one dish: curry prawns with rice. I was fascinated watching the ladies' system. The head lady takes the orders, gathers ingredients and places items in a silver dish which she lines up by the cook and the cook stir-frys each dish up and gives it back to the head lady to deliver to the customer.\n\nBack to the food: now dairy-based curry generally has a good sauce that goes good with rice. But when I was served up my dish, I found I had a reddish, oil based curry with the prawns. Foiled - not much sauce. The food was okay and definitely hot from the oven.\n\nOther male diners (with bigger appetites!) went all out ordering potstickers, curry fish noodles and fried rice and curry tofu just for two people. Some couples took out an order of the tea leaf salad on their way out. Seems like a very popular dish.\n\nIt was really interesting to watch the interplay between the ladies busting themselves to get the food out. I watched the youngest of the ladies hack (with a cleaver) at the top of a fresh coconut to pierce the shell so a straw could be inserted. Amazing.\n\nWhat else can I say?
