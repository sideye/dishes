At 5:00 pm when we arrived, it was very quiet, with just one other group of people there. Soon afterward, many, many gals came flocking to Nectar... the ratio of women to men was similar to that of a nail salon... or a convent. My friend and I were the only people of color in the place, except for our server, who was also a person of color, and who seemed to hate our guts. She gave good information about the wines when we asked questions, but she did so in an utterly bored, rote recitation sort of way. \n\nAt Nectar, it's fun to read the extremely poetic and fanciful descriptions of the wines in the wine book (something about toasted almonds kissing a tear stained cheek in autumn and a caress of spearmint... no kidding), the selection is vast, and the bar, excuse me, lounge, is pretty inside. It's apparently a place where you can bring a baby, get drunk, and no one looks askance: a Marina MILF- type teetered over to us on her narrow heels, smiling expansively, and told me her son had a huge crush on me and couldn't take his eyes off me. The son in question was an infant so young I don't think his eyes were even focused.\n\n*edit* \n\nOn my second visit to Nectar, I tried two appetizers-- one was a phyllo dough-wrapped mushroom puff with two dabs of aoli... yummy but teeny-tiny.

Who writes the retail price next to the restaurant bottled price so people know how much more they're paying to drink in house??!?...The bartender informed me that they actually sell wines there as well so if you taste a wine you enjoy, they'll sell it to you for the much lower retail price...never experienced that before...can you say AWESOME?!? (also love how they present the bottle in front of you and leave it there while you wine taste so you can inspect and read the labeling to become more familiar with the particular wine)\n\n2) Service-speedy, personal, and fun. Our bartender Alex was awesome, incredibly knowledgeable and helpful with the wine list. It was our first time there but we felt like regulars. He was funny, engaging, and personable. Later when these guys tried to talk to me and my gf...he and the other staff made sure we were okay. Everyone there was great, protective yet not intrusive, and made the experience a really enjoyable one. \n\n3) Food-we just tried the ahi tartare and salmon flatbread. Salmon flatbread was a tasty light treat that complements the wine pretty well. Can't say I'm a fan of the ahi tartare. I personally love ahi tartare but it didn't taste very fresh, too chewy, and not very flavorful. I heard the mac'n'cheese is great but we were going light that night.\n\n4) Ambiance-great. Good music, good bar seating, plenty of cozy tables and couches for more privacy. Good place to sip wine at a bar, go on a date, or bring a group of friends to socialize.\n\nOverall-loved it.

I expected it to be extremely crowded and that we'd have to wait a while but when we got there, there were plenty of seats available at the bar.

The bartender was very helpful and recommend excellent selections of wine. The food is great. I would definitely have the smoked salmon flatbread.

We were in need of some protein and carbohydrate back up after foundering ourselves on cheese. We ordered the Charcuterie platter with the house-made pate, the lomo, and the braseola. They were all very good, a testament to the beauty of porcine and bovine fabulousness two small ramekins of mustard, a dijon and a seedy brown along with olives, some thinly sliced onion, capers and bread made there way to the table with the meats and we're rapidly consumed.
